# Customer Success Analytics

> **End-to-end Data Science project** focused on **predicting client interactions, balancing CS portfolios, and monitoring team performance** with ML &Power BI dashboards.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Customer Success Analytics Project** applies data science to solve real business challenges in Customer Success operations.  
The goal is to ensure **fair distribution of new clients**, **visibility into workload**, and **clear performance tracking** for each Customer Success Specialist (CS).

The project is divided into **three phases**:

1. **Phase 1 — Automatic Distribution of New Clients**  
   - Predict total client interactions (emails + activities).  
   - Build a workload scoring system (interactions + family size).  
   - Implement automatic assignment of new clients to the most available CS.  

2. **Phase 2 — Power BI Dashboard**  
   - Create a dashboard with three views:  
     - Portfolio by CS  
     - Client Analysis  
     - Automatic Distribution  
   - Provide actionable KPIs for managers and CSs.  

3. **Phase 3 — Monthly CS Performance Analysis**  
   - Build a new dataset to monitor monthly CS performance (emails, activities, deals closed).  
   - Deliver a Power BI page with performance trends and comparisons across CSs.
